DarwinPorts 1.0 Quick notes on installation and usage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DarwinPorts system is installed by running:

	./configure && make && sudo make install

This will place a standard DarwinPorts installation in /opt/local.
You should ensure that /opt/local/bin is in your PATH environment
variable, otherwise your shell will not be able to find the executables
that are installed by DarwinPorts.

If you are using a bourne shell (Panther and Tiger by default uses
bash) add the following line to your ~/.profile file. If the file
does not exist create it.

	export PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH

If you are using a (t)csh shell (Jaguar) put the following line in
your ~/.cshrc file. If the file does not exist, create it. Your
changes will not take effect unit you have opened a new shell.

	set path=(/opt/local/bin $path)

Finally, you must download the port description files, the Portfiles:

	port sync

If you want to update the Portfiles and the DarwinPorts infrastructure (base) run:

	sudo port selfupdate

QUICK START

To search for a port and/or related, vi for example:

	port search vi

To install a port:

	sudo port install <portname>

Please read the manual page for port:

	man port

There are also manual pages for portfile, porthier and portstyle, aimed at Portfile writers.
