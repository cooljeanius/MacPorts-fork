Project naming and copyright attribution:

* "The MacPorts Project" is the string that shall be used whereever there's a need to reference our project name, such as in copyright notices.
* A developer or contributor is advised to attribute himself a copyright notice if he/she is contributing a full new source file or a full new feature
  to an already existing source file in the "base" component of our repository.
* An exception to this rule is our Portfiles, since they are partly meant for human eyes consumption and the boilerplate header comments should be kept
  down to a minimum
* A copyright notice attributed to our group name, "The MacPorts Project", should also be added to these source files (if not already there) if they're
  being uploaded to the "base" component of our repository, since as such they are being contributed to the project.


Whitespace rules as discussed on the development list (macports-dev):

* All source code files MUST use soft tabs at a tabstop of 4. No hard tabs are allowed.
* All source code files SHOULD have the following as the first line of the file:
    # -*- coding: utf-8; mode: tcl; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; c-basic-offset: 4 -*- vim:fenc=utf-8:filetype=tcl:et:sw=4:ts=4:sts=4
  This is a modeline that works for both emacs and vim.
* Portfiles SHOULD use soft tabs at a tabstop of 4, but implementation of this is left up to the discretion of the maintainer.
* Portfiles SHOULD use the given modeline
* Makefiles MUST use tabs as it is required by the syntax. Makefiles SHOULD use a tab stop of 8.
* Makefiles MAY use a modeline. The following works for emacs and vim:
    # -*- coding: utf-8; mode: Makefile; tab-width: 8; indent-tabs-mode: t -*- vim:fenc=utf-8:filetype=Makefile:noet:sw=8:ts=8
* All other files (documentation, etc) SHOULD use soft tabs at a tabstop of 4 if the document format allows.
* All other files (documentation, etc) SHOULD NOT use a modeline as it is probably meant for human consumption.
