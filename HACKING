Whitespace rules as discussed on the list:

* All source code files MUST use soft tabs at a tabstop of 4. No hard tabs are allowed.
* All source code files SHOULD have the following as the first line of the file:
    # -*- coding: utf-8; mode: tcl; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; c-basic-offset: 4 -*- vim:fenc=utf-8:filetype=tcl:et:sw=4:ts=4:sts=4
  This is a modeline that works for both emacs and vim.
* Portfiles SHOULD use soft tabs at a tabstop of 4, but implementation of this is left up to the discretion of the maintainer.
* Portfiles SHOULD use the given modeline
* Makefiles MUST use tabs as it is required by the syntax. Makefiles SHOULD use a tab stop of 8.
* Makefiles MAY use a modeline. The following works for emacs and vim:
    # -*- coding: utf-8; mode: Makefile; tab-width: 8; indent-tabs-mode: t -*- vim:fenc=utf-8:filetype=Makefile:noet:sw=8:ts=8
* All other files (documentation, etc) SHOULD use soft tabs at a tabstop of 4 if the document format allows.
* All other files (documentation, etc) SHOULD NOT use a modeline as it is probably meant for human consumption.
