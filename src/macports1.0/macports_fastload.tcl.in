# This script is here to fast load all the MacPorts related packages.
# This avoids the very expensive globbing of Tcl' package mechanism.
# Please note that this is not required and base/ should work even if some
# packages are moved as long as their new location is in Tcl's package paths.
# However, this file also defines a workaround to avoid conflicts between a /
# installation of MacPorts and a user installation of MacPorts (on the same box).
# (this workaround isn't required on 10.4.2).
#
# The package command that's replaced in this code works somewhat differently
# than the original version. In particular, users with multiple copies of a
# package such as portuninstall (due to obsolete files being left from previous
# installations) may experience problems due to different package loading
# behavior.
