# This script is here to fast load all the darwinports-related packages.
# This avoids the very expensive globbing of Tcl' package mechanism.
# Please note that this is not required and base/ should work even if some
# packages are moved as long as their new location is in Tcl's package paths.
# However, this file also defines a workaround to avoid conflicts between a /
# installation of DP and a user installation of DP (on the same box).
# (this workaround isn't required on 10.4.2).
