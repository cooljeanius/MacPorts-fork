# This script is here to fast load all the darwinports-related packages.
# This avoids the very expensive globbing of Tcl' package mechanism.
# Please note that this is not required and base/ should work even if some
# packages are moved as long as their new location is in Tcl's package paths.

# native function we provide in pextlib.
