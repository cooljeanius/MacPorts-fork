.Dt PORTALL 1 "OpenDarwin.org"
.Os 
.Sh NAME
.Nm portall
.Nd perform actions on the entire dports tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar target
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can perform various tasks on all ports of the DarwinPorts collection. Tasks are mainly 
.Ar target
\&'s that are shared with the
.Nm port
command.
.Nm
has to be called from the dports/ directory.
.Sh TARGETS
.Nm
knows several targets. The most important is the "clean" target, which cleans up all the leftovers from previous build
runs. The most useless (for most users at least) is probably the "install" target, which, as the target's name 
suggests, attempts to install all ports.
.Pp
Other targets effective with 
.Nm 
are:
.Pp
.Dl uninstall
.Dl fetch
.Dl configure
.Dl build
.Dl destroot
.Dl test
