.Sh NAME
.Nm port
.Nd build darwin ports
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl vdqfo
.Op Ar target
.Op Ar portname
.Op Fl D Ar portdir
.Op Ar options ...
.Op Ar variations ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is designed to read and execute the build instructions of a darwin port. If no 
.Ar portdir
or
.Ar portname
is specified, the current working directory is assumed.
If no
.Ar target
is specified, "build" is assumed.
Port 
.Ar options 
are specified as key=value pairs and take precedence over individual port options and system-wide settings.
Port
.Ar variations
are specified as +name, which indicates the variation is desired, and -name, which indicates the 
variation is not desired
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl v
verbose mode (generate verbose messages)
.It Fl d
debug mode (generate debugging messages)
.It Fl q
quiet mode (suppress messages)
.It Fl D
specify
.Ar portdir
.It Fl f
force mode (ignore state file)
.It Fl o
honor state files older than Portfile
.El
.Sh TARGETS
.Nm
knows several targets. The most important is the "install" target, which installs the supplied port.
.Pp
The other targets are:
.Pp
.Dl uninstall
.Dl clean
.Dl search
.Dl toc
.Pp
Besides the main targets
.Nm
takes each single stage of the port building process as a possible target. These
stages (besides "install") are:
.Pp
.Dl fetch
.Dl extract
.Dl patch
.Dl configure
.Dl build
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
Invoking
.Nm
with the "install" target on the "vim" port:
.Pp
.Dl "port install vim
.Pp
To uninstall a port, invoke
.Nm
with the "uninstall" target:
.Pp
.Dl "port uninstall vim
.Pp
To clean up after the port was build:
.Pp
.Dl "port clean vim
.Pp
Using
.Nm
to list all available ports:
.Pp
.Dl "port search .+
.Pp
To look for a specific port, supply a search string:
.Pp
.Dl "port search vim
.Pp
To list the files (table of contents) installed by a given port (in this case apr):
.Pp
.Dl "port toc apr"
.Pp
The following demonstrates invoking
.Nm
with the "extract" target on portdir "textproc/figlet" and extract.sufx set to ".tgz":
.Pp
.Dl "port extract -d textproc/figlet extract.sufx=.tgz"
.Pp
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Ex -std
