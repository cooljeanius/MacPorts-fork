# Proxy support
# Precedence is: env, macports.conf, System Preferences
# That is, if it's set in the environment, that will be used instead of
# anything here or in System Preferences.  Setting proxy_override_env to yes
# will cause any proxies set here (or in System Preferences if set there but
# not here) to override what's in the environment.
# Note that System Preferences doesn't have an rsync proxy definition.
# Also note, on 10.5, sudo will clear many environment variables including
# those for proxy support.
# Equivalent environment variables: http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY,
# RSYNC_PROXY, NO_PROXY
#

# FTP proxy:

# rsync proxy:
#proxy_rsync       hostname:12345
# hosts not to go through the proxy (comma-separated, applies to HTTP, HTTPS,
# and FTP, but not rsync):
