# Dependencies are defined by three settings:
#    depends_lib:	installed at build time and at install time
#    depends_run:	installed at install time
#    depends_build:	installed at build time
#
#    These options accept a list of depspecs. Depspecs are ':' delimited three
#    value lists of type:match:portdir. The following types are supported:
#
#	lib	- The lib type requires the match argument in the
#		    format <libraryname>.<major version>
#	bin	- The bin type requires the match argument to be the full
#		    executable name
#	<path>  - If a full path is specified as the type, the math argument
#		    must be a complete regexp.
#	portdir must be a directory, relative to the base ports software tree,
#	of a port to build and install if the depspec is not matched.
depends_lib	lib:libfetch.3:net/libfetch

# Contents is a space delimited list of all files installed by the port.
# If you do not specify a full path, the path is assumed to be relative to
# ${prefix}
