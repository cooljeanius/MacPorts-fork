ToDo Items for release 1.2:

    - Add to port(1) manpage docs for new port(1) syntax. (Signup?)
    - Add to portfile(7) manpage docs for the new startupitem keys. (Signup?)
    - Add to ports.conf(5) manpage docs on new startupitem_type option. (Signup?)


Release 1.2:

	- Enhance port command such that targets that require a port to be
	  specified will now all default to a port in current directory.
	  
	- Enhance port command to allow multiple ports per invocation.
	  Where previously one said "port install porta; port install portb", 
	  one can now say "port install porta portb".
	  
	- Enhance port command to allow use of shell-like glob patterns for
	  port selection. When a glob pattern is found, the group of ports
	  matching the glob pattern is substituted.
	  
	- Enhance port command to allow use of "psuedo" portnames to specify
	  groups of ports.
	  When one of these pseudo portnames is specified on the command line,
	  the corresponding group of ports is substituted.

	  Currently defined psuedo portnames are:
	  	current, all, installed, uninstalled, active, inactive, outdated.
	  
	  Additional psuedo portnames can be used to select ports based on a
	  regex pattern match against certain criteria. Each port selector is
	  a name, followed by a colon, followed by the desired regex pattern.
	  The selectors are:
	  variants:, variant:, description:, portdir:, homepage:, epoch:,
	  platforms:, platform:, name:, long_description:, maintainers:, maintainer:,
	  categories:, category:, and revision:
	  
	- Enhance port command to allow use of set expressions to combine
	  ports or groups of ports.
	  Supported operators are "and", "or", "not", "!", "(", ")". 
	  
	- Enhance port command to allow a port to be specified through a file:
	  url instead of via portname. This function was previously available
	  though the -D and -u options, which make less sense now that multiple
	  ports can be specified to a target.
	  
	- Under Tiger, startupitems are now by default generated for launchd
	  rather than systemstarter.
	  
	- Add new startupitem keys startupitem.executable, startupitem.logfile,
	  startupitem.logevents, startupitem.pidfile, supported for both
	  systemstarter and launchd.
