The file RELEASE_URL in this directory is used by the rsync infrastructure
at macports to control the tag from which "released" code is provided,
ultimately, at rsync://rsync.darwinports.org/dpupdate1/base.

The script handling that operation checks out from svn the code tagged by the
contents of the RELEASE_URL file, and makes that code available via rsync.
The script is at /base/portmgr/mprsyncup.

(Previous machinery checked out from cvs the tag at RELEASE_TAG, and handled by
the script /base/portmgr/dprsyncup).
